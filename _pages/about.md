I am a linguist specializing in the application of computational methods to language documentation, with a focus on endangered and under-resourced languages. My research interests center on how digital tools can enhance the documentation and analysis of linguistic data, particularly in contexts where traditional resources are limited. My current projects involve work on the Kulung language (Kiranti, Tibeto-Burman) and Sorani Kurdish (Western Iranian), where I lead efforts incorporating automatic transcription, part-of-speech annotation, and machine translation workflows into documentation pipelines. Additionally, I have developed tools for corpus-based analysis of French, including projects examining adjective distribution and the integration of Anglicisms in French journalism.

I am currently completing my PhD in Computational Linguistics at George Mason University. Previously, I was a Graduate Research Assistant in the Computer Science department on NSF-funded projects related to diaspora language data. My academic background combines linguistics, computational approaches, and cross-disciplinary collaboration, informed by international and professional experience. I am particularly invested in issues surrounding data collection in diasporic communities and the ethical, technical, and logistical challenges that accompany this work.
